# this is the nginx config for elasticsearch with authentication for remote login
# you need to create the auth file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd-elasticsearch with you username and password
# this can be done on the shell via: 'htpasswd -b -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd-elasticsearch USERNAME PASSWORD'
#
#

# prerequisite: there are three Elasticsearch nodes (or services), reachable by their names
# elastic01, elastic02 and elastic03. Change this if necessary!
